# Image Scaler

This is a simple image scaler coded in python.To use it install the necessary packages in `requirements.txt`.

## Installing the required packages

For Windows:
```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For Linux/Mac:
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## To Run

### Method 1:

This method is conviniet when you need to scale images in batch. Move all of the images into the **img** folder, and simply run `main.py`. After that you could just follow the prompts to scale your images.

### Method 2:

If you wish to scale only one image, then run `main.py`. While following the prompts you have to agree to provide a path of the image, and follow the prompts.

### Note:

Regardless of the method used by you, all the scaled images will be stored in the `editedImg` folder.
